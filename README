# Introduction

jemdoc is a light text-based markup language designed for creating websites. It
takes a text file written with jemdoc markup, an optional configuration file and
an optional menu file, and makes static websites that look something like

## Website



```bash
http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/.
```

## Writer

It was written by me, Jacob Mattingley, in 2007, and definitely isn't the type
of code I would put on my CV. Lots of people use jemdoc, especially in academia.
